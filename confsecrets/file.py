# This reference https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation
# gives the information we would need to create a YAML tag for an
# encrypted str, bytes, int, and float values.

# that will carry us to YAML encrypted items.



# With configparser, we can use either a superclass to provide encryption/decryption of scalars.
# We can also use a custom "interpolation" to provide decryption.
